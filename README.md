## What is this?
Basically, i got a xworms stub off tria.ge and threw this into ilspy
Not too sure if it compiles but it likely does

## Info
The host, Port and aes key are stored in settings.cs
In helper.cs its mostly just for collecting info like, active window, client ID, mutex etc
Main.cs is kind of self explanitory, it handles usb spreading, plugins startup and other things
Xlogger.cs is just a keylogger, nothing special

The xworm stub That I Have Decompiled Appears Too be For Version 5 (5.0-.56)
